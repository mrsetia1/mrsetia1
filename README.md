Hi, I'm Freddy. Passionate web programmer with over 5 years of experience in software development.

I have worked on various exciting projects, from developing Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems to creating web applications for government institutions.

Currently, I work as a freelance web programmer specializing in cryptocurrency and blockchain projects. I develop websites, digital wallets, and marketplace platforms in the Web3 space.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. My current focus is on blockchain technology and decentralized applications, while maintaining expertise in traditional web development.

Feel free to reach out to me:
